# web-scraping-challenge


There are two parts to this challenge:

1. Mars News - In part one of this challenge, we are to scrape the website redplanetscience.com and extract all of the titles and preview text for each article. We then are to store this list in a dictionary and print dictionary in our Jupyter notebook. This analysis can be viewed in the part_1_mars_news.ipynb notebook

2. Mars Weather - The second part of this challenge was to perform analysis of Mars weather by scraping data from the mars weather site. There are analysis questions that should be answered by the use of panda functions on the dataset. This analysis can be viewed in the part_2_mars_weather.ipynb notebook.
